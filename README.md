# SimpleSimmechanics-AerialManipulator
Simple Simmechanics/Simulink implementation for Aerial Manipulator, and trajectory tracking. 
This repository contains the code and resources for a mini project completed during my studies in Master TSI - Mobile, Autonomous and Robotic Systems (MARS) at Grenoble-INP, Grenoble, France. The project was carried out in collaboration with my colleague, Borhan HLEISS, under the supervision of Ahmad HABLY.

Contents
- Report: Detailed report explaining the mathematical model and the control methodology employed in the mini project.
- Results Video: A video showcasing the results obtained from the project is included in this repository.
- Matlab Code: Matlab code for a simple mathematical model and trajectory tracking for a flower trajectory.
- SimMechanic Implementation: SimMechanic implementation for the Aerial Manipulator.
  
Feel free to explore the contents of this repository to gain insights into the mini-project and its outcomes.
